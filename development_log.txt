String types: count errors in string lengths for test
Spent an hour debugging why a test was failing.  The implementation was where I
wanted, but the test data had a count mismatch with the actual string length.

List parsing: this seems to necessitate recursive parsing, because a list can
contain any number of lists.  I'm not used to thinking recursively.  Explored
modifying one existing (recursive) parsing function to take a stopping
condition as a parameter, but this problem requires conditional behavior as
well (return an empty string or return the remaining input stream).  Considered
modifying the return signature to include the output-in-progress and the
input-in-progress.  This seems dirty.

Would like to next examine rewrite parsing behavior to parse one token at a
time as a separate function.
