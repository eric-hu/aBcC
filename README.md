### Conventions

In general, names will follow the Clojure library naming standards.

Error handling may rely on Exceptions (which might be non-idiomatic?), println
(side effects) or something else entirely.  This is to be determined, pending
more research.  Until then, errors will be checked for, but maybe silently
handled on detection ;)
